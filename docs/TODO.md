## Notes

### Development Decisions
- **Solo Developer Approach:** Revised from team-based to realistic solo implementation (2025-06-14)
- **MVP First:** 3-week MVP, then iterate based on feedback (2025-06-14)
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui for rapid development (2025-06-14)
- **Content Strategy:** Start with Markdown/Contentlayer, migrate to Supabase later (2025-06-14)
- **Hosting:** Vercel free tier initially, upgrade as needed (2025-06-14)

### Technical Approach
- Use shadcn/ui components to save development time
- Server components by default for better performance
- Markdown files for initial content management
- Progressive enhancement philosophy
- Mobile-first responsive design

### MVP Priorities
1. Professional appearance and credibility
2. Fast loading and good SEO
3. Easy content management
4. Multi-language support (at least 2 languages)
5. Contact functionality

### Budget Reality Check
- Development: $40,000 - $60,000 (400 hours)
- Monthly costs: < $100 initially
- Using free tiers wherever possible
- Scaling costs as traffic grows

### Risk Management
- Scope creep: Stick to phased approach
- Translations: Start with 2 languages, add more later
- Performance: Monitor from day 1
- Content bottleneck: Train client early on Markdown

### Success Metrics (Realistic)
- Month 1: 500 unique visitors
- Month 6: 2,500 unique visitors
- Year 1: 10,000 unique visitors/month
- Focus on engagement over traffic initially

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Create Next.js project
2. Set up GitHub repository  
3. Configure Vercel deployment
4. Install dependencies (shadcn/ui, Contentlayer, etc.)
5. Create basic layout components
